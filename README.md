# static-site-generator

Generate HTML files from markdown. A zenburn-inspired theme is included.

## Usage

- Place your markdown files in the content directory, nested as much as you'd like.
- At the root directory, run `./main.sh` to clear the public directory, generate files, and start up the server.
- Navigate to localhost:8888 to view the created HTML files.

Example files are provided.
